You've found a dilapidated ship. You can leave at any time, but you could at least learn why it's like that.

A very short (unfinished?) story mod made for the October 2024 Outer Wilds Mod Jam. Playtime <10 minutes.
Requires both owning and knowing the plot of Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye.

Made by Asymmetrical Cavern, with technical assistance from the Outer Wilds Modding Discord.
